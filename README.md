# üöÄ URL Shortener Microservice

Welcome to the **URL Shortener Microservice**! This project is designed to showcase a lightweight, efficient URL shortening service, where users can submit URLs and receive a shortened version for easy sharing. Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and a **SQLite** backend, this service ensures high performance and scalability for URL management.

## Key Features:
- **URL Validation**: Ensures only valid URLs are accepted.
- **Redundancy Check**: Avoids generating duplicate short URLs by checking the database.
- **Efficient URL Storage**: Uses **SQLite** for lightweight, fast key-value storage.
- **Dynamic Short URL Generation**: Generates unique short URLs using **shortid**.
- **Easy Redirection**: Translates short URLs back to the original with a simple redirect.

## üöÄ How It Works:
1. **User submits a URL**: A valid URL is sent to the API.
2. **Short URL is generated**: If the URL is valid and not already stored, a unique short ID is created.
3. **Redirection**: Users can visit the short URL to be redirected to the original URL.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions:
1. Clone project
2. Install packages with `npm i` (or `pnpm i` if using pnpm)
3. Start project with `npm start`
